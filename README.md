The first dataset, focusing on Hepatitis-related data, is chosen with the goal of identifying the simplest and most easily noticeable early symptoms or physical characteristics. These characteristics serve as 'warning signs' that the public can easily self-check in their daily lives to constantly monitor their status. The second dataset is selected to provide crucial information regarding severity and mortality rates for individuals who notice potential severe warnings and are considering a hospital visit. The main purpose of second dataset are to concretely present the risks and to strengthen the willingness to act.These two purposes allow the public to understand the seriousness and potential for deterioration if medical attention is delayed. And also, encouraging people, when noticing irregularities, to actively arrange further professional check-ups with a clear awareness of the risks, preventing the situation from becoming irreversible.

From IDA, I learned how to loading the dataset from UCIrvine Machine Learning Respository and assessing the whole dataset. Running the code to find out missing values and choosing an approprriate methods to handle it. And also, I used describe. to check my dataset that doesn't have ouliers and define the independent features and dependent features.

From EDA, I am still working on this section. In order to figure out their correlations, I created the correlation heatmaps. Because not all columns are correlated, I choose the ones I think should be correlated as features. Thinking about how to explain my goal is the most challenging because I have to search deeper knowledge and try to use simple explanation in order to let my audience understanding.

The first part, I am planning to create a plot that depicts the probability of basic physical symptoms causing disease and comparing mortality rates by age and disease. The seecond part, I use the correlation heeatmap to show the correlation with other medical characteristics. This helps me interpret the importance of medical features and make predictions based on this data.
